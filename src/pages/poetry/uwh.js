      <p>Sorry for losing your keys in your dress and making you wait.</p>
      <p>Hopefully I can get as romantic as a first kiss on the second date.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I found them in my car next your popcorn and movie ticket and unheld hands.</p>
      <p>Please forgive the moon for falling into our intimate lap of converstation.</p>
      <p>Everyone but me would have reached in for a kiss.</p>
      <p>"Learn from your mistakes" is how I console that</p>
      <p>Empty hole in my bedsheet.</p>
      <p>Slowly, hours fell by our feet</p>
      <p>Settled between the gravel of the notecard "Who are you?" lists.</p>
