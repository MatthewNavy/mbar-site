      <h3>Siena, Italy</h3>
      <p>The Romans invented arches</p>
      <p>and placed them to invite marches</p>
      <p>of light onto the arms of soldiers.</p>
      <p>Like how yours rest on my shoulders.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>In the attic of your cathedral halls</p>
      <p>sits an erect column. We crawled</p>
      <p>along the carpet stairs and shared</p>
      <p>the arch of your back, you mare.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Your marble desk and my marble hands</p>
      <p>held your slow back and forth dance</p>
      <p>of velvet curves untangling a thread</p>
      <p>running through the skin we wed.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Cement is just a contraction</p>
      <p>of when we then went black from</p>
      <p>this wrong phrase: "Come close."</p>
      <p>Here, no rays could have shone.</p>
