      <p>a place my face weeps</p>
      <p>no one can listen to me speak.</p>
      <p>In her blank tone that line repeats</p>
      <p>"Our relationship is over to me."</p>

      <p>Gray curves would cover endlessly</p>
      <p>our bodies laying long feverishly,</p>
      <p>but there's no more warmth in me.</p>
      <p>Despite this hoodie, I'm going to freeze.</p>
      <p>It shuts my mouth. I can't breathe.</p>
      <p>Someone's companion, I will never be.</p>
