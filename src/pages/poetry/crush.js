      <h3>My Cougar Crush</h3>
      <p>We trod through the tasteless and novel slush</p>
      <p>dripping from the blank crust of sullen snow.</p>
      <p>The uneven earth proved as dangerous</p>
      <p>and fragile as my voice when I asked you</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>To join me in finding some divine dive.</p>
      <p>We hoped to fill our conversating stomachs</p>
      <p>and learned we were the only idiots</p>
      <p>betting we could order pizza in a frozen hell.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>And this gash was only pinched</p>
      <p>by the distracting vagrants that we happened to live with and call friends.</p>
      <p>Their uninsightful remarks bored me and into my skull.</p>
      <p>It was exhausting to defend us from the babbling of</p>
      <p>those fools.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Yet the birds and our tracks would tell you this:</p>
      <p>each step and glance we shared I most cherish.</p>
      <br></br>
